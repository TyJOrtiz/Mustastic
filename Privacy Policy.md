# Privacy Statement

## Introduction

Mustastic ("the App") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Statement explains how the App collects, uses, and discloses information when you use the App. By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## Information Collection and Use

The App uses the MusicBrainz database to look up information about music tracks stored on your computer and CDs that you may play in the App. This includes, but is not limited to, artist IDs, images, and metadata. The information gathered from MusicBrainz is displayed within the App to enhance your user experience by providing detailed information about your music collection.

With your explicit consent, the App also integrates with the Last.fm API and the Spotify API for additional functionality:
- **Last.fm Scrobbling**: The App uses the Last.fm API to "scrobble" tracks that you play in the App to your personal Last.fm account. Scrobbling allows you to track your listening habits and share them with the Last.fm community.
- **Spotify Playlists**: The App uses the Spotify API to display your Spotify playlists within the App. This feature requires your explicit consent and authorization to access your Spotify account.

## How We Use Your Information

The App accesses various APIs to retrieve the following types of information:
- **MusicBrainz**:
  - **Artist IDs**: Unique identifiers for artists to provide accurate artist information.
  - **Images**: Artist images to visually enhance the user interface.
  - **Metadata**: Detailed information about tracks, albums, and artists, such as album titles, release dates, genres, and track lengths.
- **Last.fm**:
  - **Scrobbling Data**: Tracks played in the App are sent to your Last.fm account to record your listening history.
- **Spotify**:
  - **Playlist Data**: Information about your Spotify playlists is retrieved and displayed within the App.

## Data Storage

The information retrieved from MusicBrainz, Last.fm, and Spotify is temporarily stored on your device to ensure efficient operation of the App. This data is not transmitted or stored on external servers or shared with third parties.

## User Consent

The App requires your explicit consent to use the Last.fm and Spotify APIs. You will be prompted to authorize access to your accounts before any data is retrieved or shared. You can revoke this access at any time through the respective service's settings.

## Security

The App takes reasonable measures to protect the information retrieved from MusicBrainz, Last.fm, and Spotify, and stored on your device. However, please be aware that no method of electronic storage or transmission over the internet is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Changes to This Privacy Statement

We may update our Privacy Statement from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Statement within the App. You are advised to review this Privacy Statement periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Statement are effective when they are posted within the App.
